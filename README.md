# Meguminter
The source code of the Meguminter Discord bot.
You can implement it's code in you own bot in your own bot or straight-up copy paste it. I really don't care.

You will need Node.js v16 and Discord.js v13 to run it.
If you are hosting it on Replit then you'll need the replit files and will need to update the node.js version manually to v16, which can be achived by following this: https://dev.to/arnavkr/updating-node-js-to-16-in-replit-1ep0

The plugins you'll need are mentioned in the package.json folder, they are discord.js, axios, discord-gamecord and express. Download them by typing "npm i [plugin name]" in your command line in your bot's folder.

If everything goes well, and you set your bot's token using environment files it should work.
